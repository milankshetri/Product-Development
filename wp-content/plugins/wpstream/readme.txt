WpStream is the only video streaming solution on WordPress that is designed to help you create your video streaming website without adding any load to your hosting server.

WpStream makes it possible for you to stream live content directly on your site, bypassing the need for third-party solutions. By taking control of your live stream, you can fully maximize the use of your video content, choosing how to display it, to whom, and whether you want to charge for it.




<h3>Live Streaming</h3>

<a href="https://wpstream.net/live-streaming/" target="_blank">Live Streaming on your website</a> can be carried out directly from your browser or with the help of Streaming Apps with custom RTMP.

<ul>
<li>OBS Studio</li>
<li>StreamYard</li>
<li>Restream</li>

</ul>
